# dotfiles
had to make this repo sooner or later

"dotfiles" means "bucket of stuff from your home dir", right?

## Instructions

1. clone this repo to DIR[=whatever]
2. run `source $DIR/source_me`
3. (optional) add line 2 to the shell init, i.e. `.bashrc`

Alternate instructions for zhs coming...probably never.

## Contents

Some custom git subcommands that I have found useful

A little timer thing that helps me try to apply [pomodoro].

## TODO

 - [ ] add vim settings
 - [ ] add a thing to check for dotfiles updates
